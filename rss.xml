&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg&lt;/strong&gt; (c. 1398 – 1468) was a German blacksmith, goldsmith, printer, and publisher who introduced printing to Europe. His invention of mechanical movable type printing started the Printing Revolution and is widely regarded as the most important event of the modern period. It played a key role in the development of the Renaissance, Reformation, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Scientific revolution and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his invention of the printing press, Gutenberg was the first European to use movable type printing, in around 1439. Among his many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type; the use of oil-based ink; and the use of a wooden printing press similar to the agricultural screw presses of the period. His truly epochal invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system that allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for printers and readers alike. Gutenberg’s method for making type is traditionally considered to have included a type metal alloy and a hand mould for casting type. The alloy was a mixture of lead, tin, and antimony that melted at a relatively low temperature for faster and more economical casting, cast well, and created a durable type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information — including revolutionary ideas — transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities; the sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its people led to the rise of proto-nationalism, accelerated by the flowering of the European vernacular languages to the detriment of Latin’s status as lingua franca. In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale, while Western-style printing was adopted all over the world, becoming practically the sole medium for modern bulk printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of movable type was a marked improvement on the handwritten manuscript, which was the existing method of book production in Europe, and upon woodblock printing, and revolutionized European book-making. Gutenberg’s printing technology spread rapidly throughout Europe and later the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His major work, the Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible), has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 1439, Gutenberg was involved in a financial misadventure making polished metal mirrors (which were believed to capture holy light from religious relics) for sale to pilgrims to Aachen: in 1439 the city was planning to exhibit its collection of relics from Emperor Charlemagne but the event was delayed by one year due to a severe flood and the capital already spent could not be repaid. When the question of satisfying the investors came up, Gutenberg is said to have promised to share a “secret”. It has been widely speculated that this secret may have been the idea of printing with movable type. Also around 1439–1440, the Dutch Laurens Janszoon Coster came up with the idea of printing. Legend has it that the idea came to him “like a ray of light”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;float-left&quot; style=&quot;width: 240px&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until at least 1444 he lived in Strasbourg, most likely in the St. Arbogast parish. It was in Strasbourg in 1440 that Gutenberg is said to have perfected and unveiled the secret of printing based on his research, mysteriously entitled Kunst und Aventur (art and enterprise). It is not clear what work he was engaged in, or whether some early trials with printing from movable type may have been conducted there. After this, there is a gap of four years in the record. In 1448, he was back in Mainz, where he took out a loan from his brother-in-law Arnold Gelthus, quite possibly for a printing press or related paraphernalia. By this date, Gutenberg may have been familiar with intaglio printing; it is claimed that he had worked on copper engravings with an artist known as the Master of Playing Cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1450, the press was in operation, and a German poem had been printed, possibly the first item to be printed there. Gutenberg was able to convince the wealthy moneylender Johann Fust for a loan of 800 guilders. Peter Schöffer, who became Fust’s son-in-law, also joined the enterprise. Schöffer had worked as a scribe in Paris and is believed to have designed some of the first typefaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;All that has been written to me about that marvelous man seen at Frankfurt is true. I have not seen complete Bibles but only a number of quires of various books of the Bible. The script was very neat and legible, not at all difficult to follow—your grace would be able to read it without effort, and indeed without glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/footer&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg’s workshop was set up at Hof Humbrecht, a property belonging to a distant relative. It is not clear when Gutenberg conceived the Bible project, but for this he borrowed another 800 guilders from Fust, and work commenced in 1452. At the same time, the press was also printing other, more lucrative texts (possibly Latin grammars). There is also some speculation that there may have been two presses, one for the pedestrian texts, and one for the Bible. One of the profit-making enterprises of the new press was the printing of thousands of indulgences for the church, documented from 1454–55.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1455 Gutenberg completed his 42-line Bible, known as the Gutenberg Bible. About 180 copies were printed, most on paper and some on vellum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;court-case&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#court-case&quot; aria-label=&quot;court case permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Court Case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time in 1456, there was a dispute between Gutenberg and Fust, and Fust demanded his money back, accusing Gutenberg of misusing the funds. Meanwhile the expenses of the Bible project had proliferated, and Gutenberg’s debt now exceeded 20,000 guilders. Fust sued at the archbishop’s court. A November 1455 legal document records that there was a partnership for a “project of the books,” the funds for which Gutenberg had used for other purposes, according to Fust. The court decided in favor of Fust, giving him control over the Bible printing workshop and half of all printed Bibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Gutenberg was effectively bankrupt, but it appears he retained (or re-started) a small printing shop, and participated in the printing of a Bible in the town of Bamberg around 1459, for which he seems at least to have supplied the type. But since his printed books never carry his name or a date, it is difficult to be certain, and there is consequently a considerable scholarly debate on this subject. It is also possible that the large Catholicon dictionary, 300 copies of 754 pages, printed in Mainz in 1460, may have been executed in his workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Fust–Schöffer shop was the first in Europe to bring out a book with the printer’s name and date, the Mainz Psalter of August 1457, and while proudly proclaiming the mechanical process by which it had been produced, it made no mention of Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1462, during a conflict between two archbishops, Mainz was sacked by archbishop Adolph von Nassau, and Gutenberg was exiled. An old man by now, he moved to Eltville where he may have initiated and supervised a new printing press belonging to the brothers Bechtermünze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1465, Gutenberg’s achievements were recognized and he was given the title Hofmann (gentleman of the court) by von Nassau. This honor included a stipend, an annual court outfit, as well as 2,180 litres of grain and 2,000 litres of wine tax-free. It is believed he may have moved back to Mainz around this time, but this is not certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg died in 1468 and was buried in the Franciscan church at Mainz, his contributions largely unknown. This church and the cemetery were later destroyed, and Gutenberg’s grave is now lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1504, he was mentioned as the inventor of typography in a book by Professor Ivo Wittig. It was not until 1567 that the first portrait of Gutenberg, almost certainly an imaginary reconstruction, appeared in Heinrich Pantaleon’s biography of famous Germans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg’s early printing process, and what tests he may have made with movable type, are not known in great detail. His later Bibles were printed in such a way as to have required large quantities of type, some estimates suggesting as many as 100,000 individual sorts. Setting each page would take, perhaps, half a day, and considering all the work in loading the press, inking the type, pulling the impressions, hanging up the sheets, distributing the type, etc., it is thought that the Gutenberg–Fust shop might have employed as many as 25 craftsmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg’s technique of making movable type remains unclear. In the following decades, punches and copper matrices became standardized in the rapidly disseminating printing presses across Europe. Whether Gutenberg used this sophisticated technique or a somewhat primitive version has been the subject of considerable debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the standard process of making type, a hard metal punch (made by punchcutting, with the letter carved back to front) is hammered into a softer copper bar, creating a matrix. This is then placed into a hand-held mould and a piece of type, or “sort”, is cast by filling the mould with molten type-metal; this cools almost at once, and the resulting piece of type can be removed from the mould. The matrix can be reused to create hundreds, or thousands, of identical sorts so that the same character appearing anywhere within the book will appear very uniform, giving rise, over time, to the development of distinct styles of typefaces or fonts. After casting, the sorts are arranged into type-cases, and used to make up pages which are inked and printed, a procedure which can be repeated hundreds, or thousands, of times. The sorts can be reused in any combination, earning the process the name of “movable type”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invention of the making of types with punch, matrix and mold has been widely attributed to Gutenberg. However, recent evidence suggests that Gutenberg’s process was somewhat different. If he used the punch and matrix approach, all his letters should have been nearly identical, with some variations due to miscasting and inking. However, the type used in Gutenberg’s earliest work shows other variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall flow in inexhaustible streams… Through it, god will spread his word.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;footer&gt;
			&lt;cite&gt;—Johannes Gutenberg&lt;/cite&gt;
		&lt;/footer&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, the physicist Blaise Agüera y Arcas and Princeton librarian Paul Needham, used digital scans of a Papal bull in the Scheide Library, Princeton, to carefully compare the same letters (types) appearing in different parts of the printed text. The irregularities in Gutenberg’s type, particularly in simple characters such as the hyphen, suggested that the variations could not have come from either ink smear or from wear and damage on the pieces of metal on the types themselves. While some identical types are clearly used on other pages, other variations, subjected to detailed image analysis, suggested that they could not have been produced from the same matrix. Transmitted light pictures of the page also appeared to reveal substructures in the type that could not arise from traditional punchcutting techniques. They hypothesized that the method may have involved impressing simple shapes to create alphabets in “cuneiform” style in a matrix made of some soft material, perhaps sand. Casting the type would destroy the mould, and the matrix would need to be recreated to make each additional sort. This could explain the variations in the type, as well as the substructures observed in the printed images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, they feel that “the decisive factor for the birth of typography”, the use of reusable moulds for casting type, might have been a more progressive process than was previously thought. They suggest that the additional step of using the punch to create a mould that could be reused many times was not taken until twenty years later, in the 1470s. Others have not accepted some or all of their suggestions, and have interpreted the evidence in other ways, and the truth of the matter remains very uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1568 history by Hadrianus Junius of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster in the 1430s and may have brought some of his equipment from Haarlem to Mainz. While Coster appears to have experimented with moulds and castable metal type, there is no evidence that he had actually printed anything with this technology. He was an inventor and a goldsmith. However, there is one indirect supporter of the claim that Coster might be the inventor. The author of the Cologne Chronicle of 1499 quotes Ulrich Zell, the first printer of Cologne, that printing was performed in Mainz in 1450, but that some type of printing of lower quality had previously occurred in the Netherlands. However, the chronicle does not mention the name of Coster, while it actually credits Gutenberg as the “first inventor of printing” in the very same passage (fol. 312). The first securely dated book by Dutch printers is from 1471, and the Coster connection is today regarded as a mere legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19th century printer and typefounder Fournier Le Jeune suggested that Gutenberg might not have been using type cast with a reusable matrix, but possibly wooden types that were carved individually. A similar suggestion was made by Nash in 2004. This remains possible, albeit entirely unproven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has also been questioned whether Gutenberg used movable types at all. In 2004, Italian professor Bruno Fabbiani claimed that examination of the 42-line Bible revealed an overlapping of letters, suggesting that Gutenberg did not in fact use movable type (individual cast characters) but rather used whole plates made from a system somewhat like a modern typewriter, whereby the letters were stamped successively into the plate and then printed. However, most specialists regard the occasional overlapping of type as caused by paper movement over pieces of type of slightly unequal height.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Git 작업흐름과 기본명령어]]></title><description><![CDATA[An Essay on Typography by Eric Gill takes the reader back to the year 1930.

&lt;p&gt;Git을 사용해서 파일 버전 관리를 할때 파일은 다음 3개의 상태중 하나의 상태에 있게 된다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.velog.io/images/rimu/post/4af4be68-2648-47d5-9f5f-4b77edd13313/%E1%84%89%E1%85%B3%E1%84%8F%E1%85%B3%E1%84%85%E1%85%B5%E1%86%AB%E1%84%89%E1%85%A3%E1%86%BA%202020-04-30%20%E1%84%8B%E1%85%A9%E1%84%92%E1%85%AE%201.13.22.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Modified&lt;/code&gt;
Modified file은 이름 그대로 수정된 file이다. 하지만 아직 “commited” 되지 않은 상태의 file을 말한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Staged&lt;/code&gt;
Staged file은 modified file에서 한단계 더 나아가서 곧 commit 될거라고 mark 해놓은 상태이다. 즉 modified 와 committed의 중간 상태라고 할 수 있다.
이렇게 중간 상태가 존재 하는 이유는, commit 하기전에 중간 상태를 저장할 수 있도록 하기 위함입니다. Commit을 하면 commit history에 남기도 하고, 혹시 추가 수정 사항이 있거나 다시 되돌려야 할때 까다롭기 때문에 (commit 후에도 다시 되돌리는게 가능은 함) commit 전에 중간 상태에 저장할 수 있도록 하는 것이다. 즉, commit은 해당 개발이 완전 완료 됬을때 하는 것이기 때문에, 아직 완료는 안되었지만 그래도 중간 상태를 저장할 필요가 있을때 staging을 사용하는 것.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Committed&lt;/code&gt;
수정 사항들이 git에 저장이 된 상태를 “committed” 라고 하고 이러한 행위를 “commit” 한다고 표현한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;git-basic-work-flow&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#git-basic-work-flow&quot; aria-label=&quot;git basic work flow permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Git Basic Work Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;소스코드 전체를 다운로드 받는다 (전문적인 언어로는 “git repository를 checkout 한다”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;소스코드 파일들을 수정 합니다. 즉 개발을 한다.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;수정한 파일들을 stage 한다.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;그리고 계속 해서 소스코드 파일들을 수정해 나간다.
해당 작업이 완료될때까지, 즉 commit 할 준비가 될때까지, 3,4번을 반복합니다.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;완료되면 commit 한다.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt;
프로젝트를 git repository로 만들기 위해서 사용하는 명령어. 여기서 프로젝트(project)라 함은 개발하고자 하는 소스코드들이 있는 디렉토리를 말한다. git init을 해서 git repo로 만들어야 git으로 버전 관리가 시작된다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git add&lt;/code&gt;
수정 사항들, 즉 modified 파일들을 staged 상태로 옮기는 명령어. 그리고 git repo에 새로 추가된 파일들을 staged 상태로 옮길때도 사용된다. 새로 추가된 파일들은 “untracked” 파일 이라고 하는데, git에서는 이들도 수정 사항이라고 본다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt;
staged 된 파일들을 commit 할때 사용하는 명령어&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git diff&lt;/code&gt;
개발 하고 있는 파일에 어떤 수정 사항들이 적용되었는지 보고싶을때 사용하는 명령어 입니다. 참고로 staged 된 수정 사항들은 git diff로 볼 수 없고, Modified 된 파일들만 git diff로 볼 수 있다.
(즉 git add 전에만 사용 가능 )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;
현재 상태를 보여주는 명령어. 어떠한 파일들이 modified가 되었고 어떠한 파일들이 staged가 되었는지 등의 전체적인 상황을 보여준다&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt;
Commit 내역들을 보여주고 Commit history라고도 한다. git log를 통해 이제까지 커밋 내역들을 전부 볼 수 있다. 다만 출력되는 포맷이 보기가 쉽지가 않아서 tig 같은 tool을 사용하면 훨씬 편리하다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git rm&lt;/code&gt;
원하는 파일을 git repo에서 삭제한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git mv&lt;/code&gt;
원하는 파일을 git repo 상에서 이동 시킬때 사용한다. 주로 rename 할때 사용 된다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git branch&lt;/code&gt;
Branch를 생성할 때 사용된다. Branch에 관해서는 아래를 참고하기&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt;
어떤 branch를 checkout 할때 사용되는 명령어&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;4-branch--merging&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4-branch--merging&quot; aria-label=&quot;4 branch  merging permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. Branch &amp;#x26; Merging&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branch는 나뭇가지 혹은 분점 을 뜻한다. 즉 기본이 되는 큰 줄기가 있고 그 줄기로 부터 옆으로 가지가 나는걸 의미하는데, Git의 branch 모델이 바로 이러한 구조이다. 먼저 git에서 기준이 되는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master branch&lt;/code&gt;가 있다. 그리고 각 개발자는 master branch를 checkout 먼저 하고, master branch로 부터 자신만의 branch를 만든다. 이걸 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;feature branch&lt;/code&gt;라고 한다. 그리고 feature branch를 기반으로 개발을 한 후 개발이 완료가 되고 commit을 하면 자신의 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;feature branch&lt;/code&gt;를 다시 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master branch&lt;/code&gt;로 합하게 된다. 이렇게 합하는 과정을 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt; 한다고 말한다.&lt;/p&gt;
